# Let's go ahead and create the two different shell scripts that will be executed by the systemd files.

touch /usr/local/DaVinci-Resolve-PostgreSQL-Workflow-Tools/backup/backup-"$dbname".sh

# Now, let's fill it in:
cat << EOF > /usr/local/DaVinci-Resolve-PostgreSQL-Workflow-Tools/backup/backup-"$dbname".sh

# Let's perform the backup and log to the monthly log file if the backup is successful.

# 	We also need to make sure that that .pgpass file has the correct permissions of 0600:
